# Carebit Brand Identity

This is a repository for logo icons, logotypes, images and other related content associated with [Carebit project](https://carebit.org/).

We designed three variations of logo icons (L1-3) that can be interchanged and all represent the project idea as we ([Jules](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-dubois/) & [Jordan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordananda/)) see it.
They can be used on light and dark backgrounds as suggested in our [Brand Identity guide](CARE_branding_v3.1.pdf).

## Assets

* Raster assets (.png format with transparent background where applicable) can be found in [assets_raster](assets_raster/).
* Vector assets (.svg and .pdf) along with the colormaps and font references will be released soon.
